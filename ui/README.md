# ui

Voice's admin UI: one application that administers all of voice, the
nodes included. The api serves its built files from its own origin.

A first slice exists: the tokens, the components, and five screens against
the stub (Overview, Nodes with a node inspector, Usage with a request
inspector, Route table, Changes). This file records the decisions it is
built on.

## The seam

The UI talks to voice only through [`../openapi.yaml`](../spec/openapi.yaml):
`/admin/v1` for administration, `/v1` where it shows what a caller sees.
It never talks to a node; `../spec/node.yaml` is for the machine a node runs on.

**The api is the trust boundary.** Voice's backend is Hale, and the
compiler proves what it can about the system graph up to the api's edge.
The UI is not Hale (Hale's front-end story is not far enough along to build
on), so to the compiler it is a black box, and to the api it is an untrusted
client like any other:

- Every rule is enforced by the api: validation, authorization, limits,
  budgets, which account a key may spend. The UI may check a form early for
  convenience; the api never relies on it.
- The UI holds no secrets. A key's secret and a node's enrollment token are
  shown once, as the api returns them, and never stored.
- Anything the UI can do, a script with the same credentials can do, and
  the api is designed for that.

## Design

[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md): the visual direction (hale's laboratory
instrument, adopted from DNA's face), the legibility rules (color is
earned), the screens as instruments, and the layering that lets the
reusable parts become a library.

## Stack (proposed)

- TypeScript, React, Vite, as a workspace: `packages/tokens` (framework-free
  CSS custom properties), `packages/components` (React), `apps/admin`
  (voice's screens). Nothing in `packages/` knows voice's nouns.
- Types and client generated from `openapi.yaml` (`openapi-typescript`,
  `openapi-fetch`), so a contract change is a type error rather than a
  runtime surprise.
- TanStack Query for fetching and caching; live state from the admin event
  stream (`GET /admin/v1/events`) invalidating what it names.

## Developing

Against the stub, which answers every endpoint with a canned happy path:

```sh
hale build api && api/api --port 8080      # in the repository root
cd ui && nvm use && npm install && npm run dev   # http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The dev server proxies `/v1` and `/admin/v1` to the api (`VOICE_API` to
point it elsewhere), so the UI runs on one origin in development as it does
in production. `npm run gen` regenerates the client from
`../spec/openapi.yaml`; `npm run typecheck` checks all three packages;
`npm run build` writes `apps/admin/dist`.

Layout: `packages/tokens` (`@hale/tokens`, JSON to CSS custom properties,
no framework), `packages/components` (`@hale/components`, React, no voice
nouns; voice's own state-word mapping lives in `apps/admin/src/tone.ts`),
`apps/admin` (`@voice/admin`).

## Shipping

`vite build` writes static files; the api serves them at `/`, with the
single-page fallback, beside `/v1` and `/admin/v1`. One origin, so no CORS.

## Screens

One per part of the admin API:

- **Overview:** quota headroom per account, node health, spend against
  budget, recent usage.
- **Route table:** per model, the ranked slots and why.
- **Usage:** summaries by project, account, model and day; the records.
- **Accounts:** quota windows, limits.
- **Nodes:** capabilities, cap, seats and their state, enrollment and token
  rotation.
- **Seats:** a form per engine, rendered from its `config_schema`.
- **Catalog, Projects and keys:** budgets, limits, a key's secret shown once.
- **Changes:** the audit log.
